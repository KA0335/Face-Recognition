# Face-Recognition
Identify and recognize the face

A simple model which Uses OpenCV, DNN and a trainer to detect faces and recognize them.

Run the first .py file so that its able to capture first 60 frames of the person's face as dataset.
Run the second .py file to train the model on this dataset.
Run the third file to recognize face using the web cam.

I just used DNN face detectinon model instead of the haar cascades he used to detect faces for faster better results. Also I tweeked some settings.
